  <h1>Introducing Spikewell</h1>
  <p>Spikewell is a healthcare AI company focused on streamlining hospital operations through adaptive, intelligent automation. Unlike generic systems, Spikewell’s technology customizes itself to fit each hospital’s infrastructure—reducing inefficiencies and supporting real-time decision-making without needing to rip and replace existing tools.</p>

  <p>Founded by Dr. BK Nayak, Spikewell’s mission is to bring clarity, speed, and adaptability to healthcare administration. From improving EHR usability to automating helpdesk tasks and patient workflows, the company is reimagining the digital backbone of hospitals.</p>

  <p>Spikewell works with both academic medical centers and regional health systems, offering a plug-in solution that evolves alongside their needs.</p>
